Cron is a software that allows you to schedule a time-based job in Unix-like computer operating systems.
It typically automates system maintenance or administration.
Each line of a crontab file represents a job and looks like:

* * * * * command to execute

1st * -> minute (0 - 59)
2nd * -> hour (0 - 23)
3rd * -> day of the month (1 - 31)
4nd * -> month (1 - 12)
5nd * -> day of the week (0 - 6)

Most used command to edit this file 'crontab -e' and for list the content 'crontab -l'
